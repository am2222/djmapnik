Install

Thanks for downloading djmapnik.

I recommend simply putting the 'djmapnik' directory on your
PYTHONPATH (the one with the __init__.py file inside) to play
around with this code. There is a setup.py script but this is 
alpha code at this point that will change, so no use installing
globally.
